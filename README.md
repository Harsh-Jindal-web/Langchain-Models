# LangChain-Models

This repository provides a practical guide to working with **LLMs, Chat Models, and Embedding Models** using LangChain. It includes code examples, key concept notes, and a reference video to support learning and hands-on experimentation.

## ðŸ§  Overview

LangChain simplifies the integration of various language model components and provides abstractions for:

1. **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Use foundational models for basic prompting and completions.
2. **Chat Models**: Leverage conversational agents with memory and system/user roles.
3. **Embedding Models**: Transform text into numerical representations for semantic search or vector-based operations.

This repo is designed to help you understand how these core components fit together to power AI applications.

For a detailed summary, check out the [**Notes LangChain Models.pdf**](./Notes%20LangChain%20Models.pdf) included in this repository.
